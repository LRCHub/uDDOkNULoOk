Love on a mountain top

[Love on a mountain top]

So high that we won't ever stop

[High that we won't ever stop]

Making love on a mountain

[Do do doddle do do stop]

Drinking love from a fountain

[Do do doddle do do]

Ooooh yeah You know your daddy's funny he don't go for me
He warned you honey that our love can't be
I'm from the other side of the mountain girl
But you don't care
And tonight you'll steal away with me up there. And we make Love on a mountain top

[Love on a mountain top]

So high that we won't ever stop

[High that we won't ever stop]

Making love on a mountain Do do doddle do do stop]

Drinking love from a fountain Do do doddle do do]

Your loving this poor boy like I'm some kind of king
When you know I'll never have a doggone thing
But high up on the mountain
Girl you'll find so much
It's worth a million dollars just to have your touch And we make Love on a mountain top
