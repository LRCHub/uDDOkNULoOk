Love on a mountain top,
So high that we won't ever stop,
Making love on a mountain,
Drinking love from a fountain.

You're loving this poor girl
Like I'm some kind of queen
When you know
I'll never have a doggone thing.

But high up on the mountain
Boy you'll find so much,
It's like a million dollars just to have your touch.

Love on a mountain top,
So high that we won't ever stop.
Making love on a mountain,
Drinking love from a fountain.

You know you're daddy's funny,
He don't go for me
He warned you honey,
That our love can't be
And from the otherside
