It’s been a while since
I last lost my head
Days in the sun
I found in sobriety
Toggled it up and down
in my brain
Nothing like the monsters
I grew up with
I grew up with
I’m signing it up and
just slipping out
from the pirate ship that
I thought was mine
So I buried a hatchet
and one eye patch
Now it all just seems
like they lost me forever
Give me a sign of falling water
So I can be facing the wind
one last time
Give me the light of
a lightning flicker
Then I will be dancing with
demons once more
I’m the one
who wants to burn out
I’m the one
who needs to find out
I’m the one
who craves the last match
Bitter sister asked me
“Mister, why do you think
it’s so unbearable?”
Barely answered in a whisper
“I don’t know,
it only gets emptier”
“Gets emptier”
I’m giving it up and
just slipping out
from the pirate ship that
I thought was mine
All the upshots of
my peculiar mind
Now it all just seems
like they lost me forever
Give me a sign of falling water
So I can be facing
the wind one last time
Give me the light of
a lightning flicker
Then I will be dancing with
demons once more
I’m the one
who wants to burn out
I’m the one
who needs to find out
I’m the one
who craves the last match
Get back, get back down now
I’m still all in one piece
Get back, get back down now
Things get tough from here on
Every joy I had beside you
Every path I walked beside you
Every dream I dreamed beside you
It all just seems
like they lost me forever
Give me a sign of falling water
So I can be facing
the wind one last time
Give me the light
of a lightning flicker
Then I will be dancing with
demons once more
I’m the one
who wants to burn out
I’m the one
who needs to find out
I’m the one
who craves the last match
