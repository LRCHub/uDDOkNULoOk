Well, me, my wife and our daugther
We found ourselves standing in New York
It was just a mile? of? land? and it was hard to understand
But we bought it from the indian on the run

Yeah, there we were me and daddy
We were travelling through the desert all alone
We were pinely? south? of west?
We were? just a test?
And we could get up up on the mountain top

Come on up up on the mountain top
Come on up up on the mountain top, once again
Come on up up on the mountain toooop

By the time that she had reached
The inspiration point
I saw her with an indian
Sharing a joint
Then before I could get up
Close enough to shout stop
The indian had already done his job

Come on up up on the mountain top
Come on up up on the mountain top
Come on up up on the mountain toooop

Yipiiiieee

Come on up up on the mountain top, once again
Come on up up on the mountain top, one more time
Come on up up on the mountain top

Yeah, we were me and daddy
We were travelling through the desert all alone
We were pinely? south? of west?
We were? just a test?
And we could get up up on the mountain top

Come on up up on the mountain top
Come on up up on the mountain toooop
Mountain toop
Come on up up on the mountain top, one more time
Come on up up on the mountain top, once again
Come on up up on the mountain top, for the last time
Come on up up up on the mountain top
